/**
 * A team principal's career: creation, the race weekend, the gaps between
 * Grands Prix and the end of every season.
 *
 * The career is one plain object, small enough to save whole (a season's world
 * is a few dozen drivers and a dozen teams), and every function here mutates it
 * in place and returns what the interface needs to show. React keeps it in a ref
 * and re-renders on a version counter, the way the GameLock manager does.
 *
 * The f1db bootstrap and the reference tables are not part of the career: they
 * live in a context object, built once per session, because the only time a
 * career needs history again is when a new season starts.
