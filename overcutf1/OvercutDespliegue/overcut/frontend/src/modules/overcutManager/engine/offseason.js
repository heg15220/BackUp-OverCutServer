/**
 * The turn of the year.
 *
 * Two forces decide next season, and the manager needs both:
 *
 *   what you did   your car is built from this year's car, the advantage that
 *                  carries over and the work your factory put into next year's
 *                  design. Your drivers are the ones you kept and signed.
 *   what happened  while history has data, every rival is pulled most of the way
 *                  towards where it really was the following year - its car, its
 *                  line-up, the teams that really arrived and folded. You can
 *                  bend Formula 1 history; you cannot stop Brawn turning up in
 *                  2009. Past the last real season, the world runs on its own.
 *
 * A real driver who really retired, retires - unless he is under contract to
 * you, in which case he races on in your car.
