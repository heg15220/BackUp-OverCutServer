 *                    (Trayectoria's `countingRoundsFor`).
 *   one car counts   until 1978 a constructor scored only with its best-placed
 *                    car in each race.
 *
 * The constructors' title was first awarded in 1958; earlier seasons still keep
 * the table, because a team principal is judged by it, but it is unofficial.
